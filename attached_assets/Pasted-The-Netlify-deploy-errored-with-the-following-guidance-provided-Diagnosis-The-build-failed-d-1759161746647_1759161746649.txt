The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to secrets being detected during the build, which caused the build script to return a non-zero exit code.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the secrets `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` are not exposed in any files in your repository.
2. If these secrets are necessary and were not meant to be detected during the build, you can use `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS`, `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS`, or `SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED` to prevent them from being detected. This allows you to exclude specific paths or keys from the secrets scanning.
3. Make sure to address the issues related to the detected secrets and re-run the build.
