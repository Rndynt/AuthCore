The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with a TypeScript error at [line 71](#L71) in the file `src/dev.ts`. The error states "Property 'organizationInvite' does not exist on type 'InferAPI'".

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `organizationInvite` property is correctly defined in the type 'InferAPI' in the codebase.
2. If `organizationInvite` is a property from an external package, ensure that the package is included in the `package.json` file or the file was committed to the repository. If needed, add the package to the external configuration in the build settings.
